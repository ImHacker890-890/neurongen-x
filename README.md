NeuroGen-X is an advanced self-learning neural network for text generation, capable of producing stories, fairy tales, documents, and other text formats. The model combines Transformer architecture with reinforcement learning for continuous improvement.

## Features

- üß† Hybrid Transformer architecture with RL components
- üìö Learns from raw text without pre-trained weights
- ‚úçÔ∏è Generates coherent text in various styles
- üîÑ Continuous self-improvement through reinforcement learning
- ‚öôÔ∏è Custom BPE tokenizer trained from scratch

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ImHacker890-890/neurongen-x.git
cd neurongen-x
```
2. Install dependencies:
